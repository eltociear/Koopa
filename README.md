This is the official codebase for the paper: [Koopa: Learning Non-stationary Time Series Dynamics with Koopman Predictors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18803.pdf), Neurips 2023. 

## Introduction

Koopa is a **lightweight**, **MLP-based**, and **theory-inspired** model for efficient time series forecasting. 

- Compared with the advanced but painstakingly trained deep forecasters, Koopa achieves state-of-the-art performance while saving **77.3%** training time and **76.0%** memory footprint.

- Focus on portraying ubiquitous **non-stationary** time series, Koopa shows **enhanced model capacity** empowered by the modern Koopman theory that naturally addresses the nonlinear evolution of real-world time series.

- Koopa differs from the canonical Koopman Autoencoder without the reconstruction loss function to achieve **end-to-end predictive training**.

## Preparation

1. Install Python 3.7 and the necessary dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. All the six benchmark datasets can be obtained from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CC4ZrUD4EKncndzgy5PSTzOPSqcuyqqj/view?usp=sharing) or [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/b8f4a78a39874ac9893e/?dl=1).

## Training scripts

We provide the Koopa experiment scripts and hyperparameters of all benchmark datasets under the folder `./scripts`.

```bash
bash ./scripts/ECL_script/Koopa.sh
bash ./scripts/Traffic_script/Koopa.sh
bash ./scripts/Weather_script/Koopa.sh
bash ./scripts/ILI_script/Koopa.sh
bash ./scripts/Exchange_script/Koopa.sh
bash ./scripts/ETT_script/Koopa.sh
```

## Applicable for Rolling Forecast

- By adapting the operator on the incoming time series during rolling forecast, the proposed model can achieve more accurate performance via adapting to continuous distribution shift.

- The na√Øve implementation of operator adaptation is based on the DMD algorithm. We propose an iterative algorithm with reduced complexity. The details can be found in the Appendix of our paper.
